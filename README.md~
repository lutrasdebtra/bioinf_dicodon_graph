# DiCodon Graph

Uses the Google graph API to map both the dicodon frequencies, and individual codon frequences throughout a user inputted sequence or fasta file. 

![Example](https://raw.github.com/lutrasdebtra/bioinf_dicodon_graph/master/Splash.png)

The dicodon frequencies are specific to a single organism. Currently the site uses an example bacteria, but the while in `/lib/data/LZ1561_CPI_DetectableOrfs_2.txt` is easy enough to copy and alter.
