# DiCodon Graph

Uses the Google graph API to map both the dicodon frequencies, and individual codon frequences throughout a user inputted sequence or fasta file. 

![Example](https://raw.github.com/lutrasdebtra/bioinf_dicodon_graph/master/Splash.png)

Graphs are displayed 60 codons at a time, and have mouseover callouts for each specific datapoint. 

## Dicodon Frequencies

The dicodon frequencies are specific to a single organism. Currently the site uses an example bacteria, but the while in `/lib/data/LZ1561_CPI_DetectableOrfs_2.txt` is easy enough to copy and alter. Once the file is altered, the database will need to be reseeded.

# Codon Frequencies

Individual codon frequencies do not require additional files, and is an extention of my eariler work with [NucleotideFinder](https://github.com/lutrasdebtra/NucleotideFinder)
